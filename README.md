## Hey, I'm Dustin 👋
    
I'm currently learning IT at [iSTTS](https://istts.ac.id/).

Currently working on a small C++ project. You can see it in the pinned repositories.

## What I use

Mostly I use:
<ul>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
</ul>

But I also have experience with:
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>Batch Scripting</li>
</ul>

Learning:
<ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Fortran</li>
    <li>Assembly</li>
</ul>

Also, for OS, I mostly use Windows, but I also use Fedora Linux.
Don't expect too much, I'm still learning.
